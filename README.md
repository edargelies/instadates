# instadates
Gets the dates from a file of instagram links.

## Example Execution
In the terminal run the following:
```bash
sh get_timestamps.sh instainputs.txt
```
This will take the carriage return separated list of Instagram links in the instainputs.txt file and print the dates of each to a file named output.txt.

In the same manner, you can create any file of Instagram links and use it as an input to the script e.g.

```bash
sh get_timestamps.sh yourfilename
```
